#### Dan's Notes:
- When I compared the assignment mock-up to my finished version it all looked very similar.  The one thing that bothered me was the weight of the font in `<h2>` and `<h3>` headings in the main content and aside.  While the font matched the mock-up closely, it looked heavier than the mock-up for both headings, and certainly drew my eye to the heavy font. When I changed the weight of the `<h2>` and `<h3>` fonts, it looked more balanced to me, though the text aligned a bit differently than the text in the mock-up.  It seemed more appealing to the eye. 

- The other thing that bothered me, but I didn't change, was the color of the different sections.  It was not part of the criteria, and the finished colors matched the mock-up, but my subjective eye would have preferred to see the header, main, and aside sections match color for more continuity instead of three different shades of blue.
